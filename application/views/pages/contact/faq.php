	            <p>The Tig&eacute; name is based on &ldquo;Tiger,&rdquo; the childhood nickname of company founder Charlie Pigeon. Dropping the &ldquo;r&rdquo; and adding an accent over the &ldquo;&eacute;&rdquo; gave the name a European flair that complimented the flowing, euro&ndash;design of the company&rsquo;s first boat models. The unusual name also helped differenciate the Tig&eacute; brand from the competition.</p>
