    <p>The Tig&eacute; LifePlus Lifetime Replacement Warranty is the only replacement warranty in the industry, and it&rsquo;s a bold statement about our faith in Tig&eacute; quality and product integrity. The Tig&eacute; LifePlus Lifetime Replacement Warranty fully covers the integrated LifePlus Core construction of the boat, which includes hull, stringers and flooring. Buy a new Tig&eacute;, and if there is ever any structural failure, degradation or delamination for as long as you own your boat, Tig&eacute; will replace it with a new boat at no charge. Other boat manufacturers offer hull warranties that cover only the repair of defective lamination or structure. This usually means the owner is responsible for transporting the defective boat to the manufacturer for repair. The owner is then left with a repaired boat that seldom performs as well as the original.</p>
    <p>There has never been a single incident of structural failure in any Tig&eacute; hull, floor or stringer component. This is one important reason that Tig&eacute; is the only manufacturer that can offer the most solid, far&ndash;reaching warranty in the business. In addition to the LifePlus Lifetime Replacement Warranty, Tig&eacute; backs the non&ndash;laminated components in our boats with a Three-Year Bow-to-Stern Limited Warranty. This covers upholstery, steering and throttle assemblies, TAPS<sup>2</sup> and other Tig&eacute;&ndash;installed components and accessories.</p>
