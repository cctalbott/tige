	<p>TigéTouch brings preset cruise technology to a whole new level with TigéYou. TigéYou profiles work seamlessly with SpeedSet to give you the ultimate user experience, which, after intial setup, is as close as it gets to doing nothing at all. Presets can be saved for boating scenarios, from cruising the lake, to port side surfing or professional level wakeboarding.</p>
	<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Adjust everything in the boat to the way that your rider wants it. Fill the ballast to desired levels, set the Tig&eacute; SpeedSet to the preferred speed, and position TAPS<sup>2</sup> to that perfect setting for the riders level.</li>
		<li>Once everything is set. Go. The Tig&eacute;Touch operating system will take control and bring the boat precisely to all of the settings, once there, you can dial in and tweak the settings while your Tig&eacute; is underway.</li>
		<li>When all settings are exactly where the rider prefers, hit &ldquo;Save as Profile&rdquo; on the SpeedSet screen.</li>
		<li>Done! The settings are then dropped in as a Tig&eacute;You Profile that you can name and keep as long as you like.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The next time you want to use the set profile, Tig&eacute;You has locked in all of the rider preferences. Select the profile, and your Tig&eacute; will automatically adjust to all of the individual profile settings.</p>
