	<p>All switch controls are now located in the interface of Tig&eacute;Touch. This innovative approach has allowed for easy operation of boat features, as well as eliminating the unnecessary clutter of analog switches in our modern, low&ndash;profile dash design.</p>
	<h3 class="subHeader">Redundant Switching<h3>
	<p>Common in the aviation industry, Tig&eacute; has created duplicate manual switches for all Coast Guard required boat operations. Under the helm, you will find manual switches for Bilge, Blower, Lights, and Ballast Empty functions, designed to automatically override the Tig&eacute;Touch operating system. This redundancy secures that the vital operations of your boat will be available in any circumstance.</p>
