	<p>The lighting in your Tig&eacute; now starts with Tig&eacute;Touch. With the turn of the ignition key, the touchscreen display is backlit. This allows for easy, well&nhash;lit access to your light switches. Gone are the days when you enter a boat at night and fumble for any switch that can light up your boat.</p>
	<p>Tig&eacute;Touch also brings the industry first &ldquo;All Lights&rdquo; function. This switch immediately activates every light in your Tig&eacute;, from the Alpha Z tower lights, to the underwater transom and the courtesy lights. Tig&eacute;Touch light switching also allows you operate the individual lights of your choice.</p>
