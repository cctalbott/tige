	<p>Tig&eacute;Touch has made accurate, precision speed control simple. Tig&eacute; SpeedSet is not only the most advanced precision digital speed control in the marine industry, it&rsquo;s also the easiest to use. While other speed control systems make you follow complicated instructions and endless menu items, Tig&eacute; SpeedSet is easy to learn and is easily accessible, located at the top of most Tig&eacute;Touch screens.</p> 
	<p>The SpeedSet functions within the Tig&eacute;Touch display and features clear visibility and a large tactile button pad that is great for easy speed control without taking your eyes off the waterway. SpeedSet readouts appear in large type on the Tig&eacute;Touch color display on the right side of the dash. Basic operation is similar to the cruise control in your car. Throttle up to speed, engage SpeedSet and that&rsquo;s it. Using intuitive SpeedSet &ldquo;Save to Profile,&rdquo; you can program up to 20 profile settings, on-the-fly, for individual riders or skiers.</p>
