        <h3>Making The Best Even Better</h3>
		<div class="sectionContent">
        	<p>How do you make the world&rsquo;s best inboard power train even better? Make it part of a Tig&eacute;. PCM Marine engines and transmissions are clearly the most elite, fuel efficient and reliable power plants in the industry, with a proven record of superior performance and customer satisfaction. Combine PCM with the advanced Tig&eacute; ConvexV hull, superior engineering and TEC electronics and you achieve a new level of performance far beyond the reach of any other inboard or stern drive. This means more speed, quicker acceleration and greater fuel efficiency. PCM also delivers quieter, vibration&ndash;free operation. And the superior engineering and quality of both boat and power train make the/PCM combination unbeatable in terms of reliability, safety and long&ndash;term durability. Tig&eacute; and PCM&hellip;the best is now better.</p>

	                <h4>Quiet, Vibration&ndash;Free Operation</h4>
	                <p>The advanced engineering and superior quality of both boat and power train deliver far quieter operation. PCM engines and Power Plus&reg; transmissions are precision engineered and quality&ndash;built for smooth, super&ndash;quiet operation. PCM Adjust&ndash;a Flex&reg; engine mounts are heavier, better designed and far superior to any other inboard engine mounts. Tig&eacute; through&ndash;bolts these superior mounts to 2" Penske Composite beams fitted with structural aluminum saddle units. The result is the most unyielding power plant foundation in the industry and the quietest, most vibration&ndash;free operation of any inboard.</p>
