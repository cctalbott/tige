    <p>TAPS<sup>2</sup> technology allows the driver to precisely trim the ConvexV hull for a full range of wake characteristics. Set TAPS<sup>2</sup> in the down position (1&ndash;2) for instant planing, optimum forward visibility and clean, faint slalom wakes.  Adjust TAPS<sup>2</sup> on the fly to adjust wake size or to trim for optimum cruising comfort, fuel efficiency, top speed or other performance factors.  Because of its unique rocker shape, the ConvexV hull settles naturally at boarding speeds with TAPS<sup>2</sup> set high (7&ndash;8). No need for ballast or awkward drag hardware that destroy performance and can damage your boat.</p>

        	<h5>Why Is Tig√© The Only One?</h5>
            <p>If hull trim is so beneficial, why is Tig&eacute; the only inboard to offer it? Because the design and technology behind our fully trimmable hull is protected by U.S. Patents for design and application. The dramatic success of TAPS<sup>2</sup> technology relies on the patented rocker shape of the ConvexV hull, which allows a full range of hull movement up and down. So&ndash;called &ldquo;wake plates&rdquo; on other inboards are only sad and ineffective imitations of this proven Tig&eacute; technology, since all other inboards have a permanent hook that prohibits variable trim. Wake plates or not, all other inboards are literally stuck with the severe limitations of the outdated static hull regardless of the proven benefits of the trimmable ConvexV hull.</p>

        	<h4 id="trimadvantages1">TRIM FOR WAKE VERSATILITY, PERFORMANCE AND MORE</h4>
          <div id="trimadvantages1p">
            <p>Tig&eacute; is the only inboard that allows you to go from a wakeboarding wake to a slalom wake in less than five seconds. No tanks to fill or empty, no dangerous drag hardware to deploy&hellip;just push the TAPS<sup>2</sup> button and you&rsquo;re ready to go. But instant wake versatility is just one of the benefits of the world&rsquo;s only trimmable inboard.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<h4 id="trimadvantages2">NO BALLAST&hellip;NO WORRIES</h4>
        	<div id="trimadvantages2p">
        	  <p>All other inboards require heavy ballast or drag hardware to produce even entry&ndash;level wakeboarding wakes. A major hassle, it&rsquo;s a fact of life locked&ndash;into the hooked, static hull design. Well, Tig&eacute; has changed all that. With its patented rocker shape and full trim capability, the Tig&eacute; ConvexV hull settles naturally at wakeboarding or surfing speeds, creating tremendous water displacement and huge wakes without ballast. Want to boost the Tig&eacute; wake even more? You&rsquo;ll find that your Tig&eacute; needs far less ballast than all other inboards to achive the same pro&ndash;level results.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<h4 id="trimadvantages3">WEDGES AND WEIGHT DROWN PERFORMANCE</h4>
          <p id="trimadvantages3p">Ballast and drag hardware make an inboard drive like a bulldozer. Try a tight turn with the tanks full or the hydrofoil deployed&hellip;so much for nimble inboard handling. In contrast, the trimmable Tig&eacute; ConvexV hull and TAPS<sup>2</sup> technology dramatically enhance boat performance and handling while safely delivering outstanding world&ndash;class wakes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<h4 id="trimadvantages4">HIGHER TOP SPEED QUICKER ACCELERATION</h4>
        	<div id="trimadvantages4p">
            <p>Adjusting TAPS<sup>2</sup> allows you to precisely trim the ConvexV hull to reduce drag, achieve higher top speeds and quicker acceleration without increasing horsepower. Stern&ndash;drive enthusiasts know what we&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<h4 id="trimadvantages5">BIG BOOST IN FUEL ECONOMY</h4>
        	<div id="trimadvantages5p">
            <p>Reducing drag through precise hull trim also significantly reduces fuel use, making Tig&eacute; the world&rsquo;s most fuel&ndash;efficient inboard. By design, all other inboards are stuck with excessive drag and excessive fuel consumption. Add the required hydrofoil drag hardware plus thousands of pounds of ballast and you can understand why all other inboards spend so much time at the gas pump.</p>

        	<h4 id="trimadvantages6">WITHOUT THE CONVEX V ROCKER&hellip;A PLATE IS JUST A PLATE</h4>
        	<div id="trimadvantages6p">
            <p>So&ndash;called &ldquo;wake plates&rdquo; on other inboards are only sad imitations of proven Tig&eacute; technology. All other inboards have a permanent hook in the hull that locks the boat into a fixed, bow&ndash;down running attitude. The hook prevents the bow from rising and prohibits variable trim. The dramatic success of TAPS<sup>2</sup> technology relies on the patented rocker shape of the ConvexV hull, which allows a full range of hull movement up and down. Running attitude is quickly adjusted by repositioning TAPS<sup>2</sup>. That&rsquo;s why TAPS<sup>2</sup> works and all the imitators are simply empty plates.</p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
        	<h4 id="trimadvantages7">DIAL IN COMFORT, SAFETY AND A DRY RIDE</h4>
        	<div id="trimadvantages7p">
            <p>Full trim capability is a big part of why the Tig&eacute; ride and safety are superior to all other inboards. The ability to make precise adjustments to running attitude allows the driver to soften the ride, reduce noise and maximize passenger comfort and safety. Trimming in chop and rough conditions also keeps passengers dry and happy.</p>

        	<h4 id="trimadvantages8">BENEFITS OF HULL TRIM&hellip;NO COMPROMISE</h4>
        	<div id="trimadvantages8p">
            <p>Tig&eacute; is the clear choice for stern&ndash;drive enthusiasts who crave the superior handling and wake performance of an inboard. Trade that bulky, wake&ndash;spoiling stern drive unit for the clear advantages of the only inboard that delivers all the benefits of full trim capability plus world&ndash;class watersports performance unmatched by any other boat.</p>

        	<div id="trimadvantages9p">
            <p>Tig&eacute; is the only inboard that can produce an outstanding surf wake on either side. Full trim capability and the unique shape of the ConvexV hull allow you to dial in port or starboard side to get a clean sweet spot with enough juice to keep you going all day.</p>
